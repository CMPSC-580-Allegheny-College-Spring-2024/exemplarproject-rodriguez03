  * This project is important in developing new features towards fact checkers amongst various fields. For example, there might be opportunities that work towards building better softwares that ensure people are not reading and receiving fake news. The internet is accessible to everyone therefore having software that can correct the information that people are accessing is important for educational purposes. The purpose of this project is to utilize machine learning to ensure that false information is not loosely given within specific fields. Therefore, testing it on different data bases is essential to ensure that this project is secured. These two articles will be essential in learning how Text Analysis can be incorporated with Machine Learning to create a fact checker system.
